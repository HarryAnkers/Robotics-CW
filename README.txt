Robotics coursework
===================

This was a repo for a running coursework completed for a robotics class.
The project was to create a robot from scratch using a brick-pi kit. We
then calibrated and programmed the robot to meet certain spec requirements
(e.g. location finding, navigation, and monte-carlo localisation).
